		<p>
    My research interests lie in the area of graph theory, with a focus on directed graphs and their structure.
		Specifically, I am interested in exploring dualities in directed and undirected graphs using tools such as width-parameters, obstructions, and substructures.
		I am most curious about understanding the structure of directed graphs excluding certain butterfly minors.
		Is there a structure theorem comparable to the one by Robertson and Seymour for graph minors describing the structrue of digraphs excluding a fixed digrap as butterfly minor?
